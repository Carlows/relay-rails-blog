### WIP: Blog application powered by Rails, react, graphql and Relay.

This blog is an exploration excerise to understand two new technologies - GraphQL and Relay. It's a work in progress and this repository will update as we move further with this application.

```
git clone git@github.com:gauravtiwari/relay-rails-blog.git
cd relay-rails-blog
